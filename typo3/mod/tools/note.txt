NOTE:

The mod/tools/ section is meant to be for admin-users ONLY (where the admin-flag is set), so all access configurations should be set to "admin"
If you want access-minded modules for ordinary users, the mod/user module is suggested.

All language labels (except module name and short description in the $conf-files) are in english for administrators.
