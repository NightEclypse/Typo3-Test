- Checkboxes: "Typically a user would expect to set the flag by checking the checkbox, but the checkbox rather enables another checkbox which must be set (and the two checkboxes next to each other are somewhat confusing). If the first checkbox would be replaced by a button labeled "Change" this would be more clearly to a user." (My note: "[ ] Change?" where label "Change" would disappear after reload and the first time such a checkbox were clicked a message would also appear telling what happens...)
