This folder contains the patches that have been applied to the vanilla
release of ADOdb before it has been packaged in this extension.

The changes aren't as clean as they should be, but are needed for the
DBAL extension that relies on this extension to be present. Most
other code using this ADOdb library won't notice the changes done.

There is a specific patch for use with DBAL on MS SQL Server here,
why is it listed separately? This is due to the fact, that we do not fully
know whether the fixed behaviour is caused by the DB itself or maybe
the connection method used when testing.
