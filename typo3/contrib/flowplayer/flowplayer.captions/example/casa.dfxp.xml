end="0:00:10.46" style="1">Ive heard of other programs like this but most of them are all geared toward the engineers</p>      <p begin="0:00:05.59" end="0:00:10.46" style="1">I've heard of other programs like this but most of them are all geared toward the engineers</p>      <p begin="0:00:10.46" end="0:00:16.48" style="1">or it's the final year of the engineer that you finally get to build a project</p>      <p begin="0:00:16.48" end="0:00:20.07" style="1">some culmination for all your work we've been doing that the whole four years</p>      <p begin="0:00:20.07" end="0:00:25.58" style="1">that we've been here and it really does make for an incredible learning environment</p>      <p begin="0:00:25.58" end="0:00:29.72" style="1">The professors are very one on one with the students and individualize with us</p>      <p begin="0:00:29.72" end="0:00:33.89" style="1">it's more of a friendship with the teachers instead of just a professor</p>      <p begin="0:00:33.89" end="0:00:38.14" style="1">in a regular lecture hall or something it's more one on one</p>      <p begin="0:00:38.14" end="0:00:43.70" style="1"> You got your different majors in CASA I'm in EST and then there's like four areas of study</p>      <p begin="0:00:43.70" end="0:00:49.30" style="1">that go into that your biomedical networking communications and industrial electronics technology</p>      <p begin="0:00:49.30" end="0:00:52.64" style="1">I plan to work in a dental office as a dental hygienist</p>      <p begin="0:00:52.64" end="0:00:57.90" style="1">Southern was the only dental hygiene school in Illinois that has a bachelor's degree</p>      <p begin="0:00:57.90" end="0:01:05.13" style="1">in dental hygiene and we perform cleanings on children at schools, visit nursing homes</p>      <p begin="0:01:05.13" end="0:01:10.46" style="1">and perform cleanings there We just get alot of experience outside of school</p>      <p begin="0:01:10.46" end="0:01:11.80" style="1">to get us ready for the real world</p>      <p begin="0:01:11.80" end="0:01:15.63" style="1">I have a really good time with this especially when we do work in the 737</p>      <p begin="0:01:15.63" end="0:01:21.72" style="1">Our professors and instructors push us to get things going like this plane we pretty much</p>      <p begin="0:01:21.72" end="0:01:27.36" style="1">got it running a couple of years ago and now its pretty much fully operational Its great</p>      <p begin="0:01:27.36" end="0:01:32.35" style="1">and you learn so much you get a lot of hands on experience working on live aircraft like this</p>      <p begin="0:01:32.35" end="0:01:37.30" style="1">The glass cockpit is two 15 inch screens  those screens provide you with all the information</p>      <p begin="0:01:37.30" end="0:01:41.10" style="1">that each gauge used to provide and it provides it in one centralized location</p>      <p begin="0:01:41.10" end="0:01:45.00" style="1">besides that it also provides a moving map like GPS type display</p>      <p begin="0:01:45.00" end="0:01:48.90" style="1">I would definitely say it’s a very good option they are providing us now</p>      <p begin="0:01:48.90" end="0:01:53.86" style="1">The club is an organization of students that  kind of wanted to go beyond the classroom</p>      <p begin="0:01:53.86" end="0:01:59.28" style="1">The whole point of it was you know this is what we do with what we learn every concept</p>      <p begin="0:01:59.28" end="0:02:04.57" style="1">that they picked up in all their classes digital analog discreet everything they applied in</p>      <p begin="0:02:04.57" end="0:02:08.90" style="1">in the dawgzooka project They started looking around at parts they asked the SIU Police</p>      <p begin="0:02:08.90" end="0:02:13.76" style="1">department they donated several old bomb disposal chassis that they could build on</p>      <p begin="0:02:13.76" end="0:02:19.17" style="1">and these principles they apply is what culminates into that final product</p>      <p begin="0:02:19.17" end="0:02:23.66" style="1">it’s great just build of everything that you learn</p>      <p begin="0:02:23.66" end="0:02:26.90" style="1">SIU is one of the only state schools that offers this program</p>      <p begin="0:02:26.90" end="0:02:29.64" style="1">that’s one of the  main reasons is because it is a  bachelors degree program</p>      <p begin="0:02:29.64" end="0:02:34.06" style="1">and it’s got the option for three different specializations</p>      <p begin="0:02:34.06" end="0:02:38.37" style="1">you’ve got CTMRI ultrasound and then you’ve got radiation therapy</p>      <p begin="0:02:38.37" end="0:02:43.75" style="1">I see it as the ability to pursue different job opportunities and also job security</p>      <p begin="0:02:43.75" end="0:02:47.50" style="1">mostly we’r e all really excited about clinicals because you don’t have to take any classes</p>      <p begin="0:02:47.50" end="0:02:51.95" style="1">when your doing it and it’s just kind of a real relief  to be out working rather than</p>      <p begin="0:02:51.95" end="0:02:53.67" style="1">taking classes all the time</p>      <p begin="0:02:53.67" end="0:02:57.91" style="1">That second semester when you got out to clinics and you actually had a real patient</p>      <p begin="0:02:57.91" end="0:03:05.25" style="1">you had real life scenarios and your working with real people that were trained to do the same</p>      <p begin="0:03:05.25" end="0:03:10.91" style="1">thing and you’re their as a student but your being treated essentially as an equal</p>      <p begin="0:03:10.91" end="0:03:15.92" style="1">and you get that real life experience and  it just adds to your education</p>      <p begin="0:03:15.92" end="0:03:24.07" style="1"></p>	 </div>   </body> </tt>
